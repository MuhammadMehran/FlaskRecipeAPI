You can replace soda water with ice cold water but result will be slightly different.~Preparing the batter ahead of time is not recommended. Mix the batter just before frying.~Maintain a consistent temperature, if the temperature is too low, the batter will absorb oil and won't crisp up; too high, and it will burn.~If you are frying both seafood and vegetables, try to fry vegetables first, then fry seafood.",https://www.foodfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ID-R00113-4.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/587lN7WTKYQ?rel=0
